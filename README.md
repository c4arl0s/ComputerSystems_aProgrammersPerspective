* Preprocessing Phase.
* Compilation Phase.
* Assembly Phase.
* Linking Phase.

**Preprocessing Phase**
The preprocessor modifies the original C program according to directives that begin withe # character. 
**Compilation Phase**
The compiler translates the text file into the text file .s, which contains an assembly-language program. Each stateent in an assembly-language program exactly describes one low-level machine-language instruction in standard text form.
**Assebly Phase**
Next, the assembler translates into machine language instructions, packages them in a form known as a relocatable object program, and stores the result in the object file *.o. This file i a binary file whose bytes encode machine language instructions rather than characters. If we were to view .o file with a text edito, it would appear to be gibberish.
**Linking Phase**
Notice that our program calls the printf function, which is part of the standard C library privided by ever C compiler The printf function resides in a separate precompiled object file called printf.o, which must somehow be merged with our hellow.o program. The linked (ld) handles this mergin. The result is the hello file,w hich is an executable object file (or simply executable) that is ready to be loaded into memory and executed by the system.
